# Quoridor Strategic Game AI

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Quoridor board game** along with an AI agent capable of playing against a human opponent. Developed as a course project for *CS246: Artificial Intelligence* at the American University of Armenia, this project demonstrates the use of classical AI algorithms to navigate adversarial and pathfinding challenges.

## Project Overview

Quoridor is a strategic board game where players race to reach the opposite side of a 9x9 grid while placing walls to block opponents. This AI agent leverages **Minimax with alpha-beta pruning** and heuristic functions to make optimal moves and strategically place walls to hinder its opponent. The game environment was built using **PyGame**, allowing for interactive play between human users and the AI agent.

## Features

- **AI Agent:** Implements Minimax with alpha-beta pruning for decision making.
- **Heuristic Functions:** Balances pathfinding and opponent obstruction strategies.
- **Adaptive Strategies:** Dynamically adjusts between movement and wall placement based on the game stage.
- **PyGame Interface:** Interactive graphical interface for playing against the AI.
